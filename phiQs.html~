<li>Are their implications for responsibility (see line page 22 about "wanton criminals").</li>
<li>Bottom of page 22 where it talks about not being able to be mistaken about consciousness. Describe this position and who it is ascribed to most commonly.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Who was Copernicus?
Copernicus had a stroke. Apparently awoke from a coma to view the pages of his book and then died peacefully. They identified his skeleton (not found until 2010) by matching DNA to hair from a book in a library in Sweden.</li>
<li>There is an important line here: "the universe was an orderly whole, in which displacing any part would disrupt the entire edifice." Why does it mean? Why is it important?</li>
<li>What is brain death?</li>
<li>Who was Wilder Penfield?</li>
<li>Why is he included here?</li>
<li>What was Penfield's theory of the brain and consciousness?</li>
<li>What is the cerebrum?</li>
<li>What are the black spaces in the MRI scan on page 27?</li>
<li>What is the Greek origin of the term Thalamus?
bedroom</li>
<li>What does "Functional Specialization" mean?</li>
<li>Where is the region of the brain specialized for detecting motion?</li>
<li>What is described by "Gallileo thought of the translucent mass, gutlike in its folds&#x2026;"</li>
<li>Key discussion question: is there a region of the brain for consciousness. Discuss Frick's condition. Evidence pro and con.</li>
<li>What is the term for the condition where people cannot recognize faces? 
Prosopagnosia.</li>
<li>"And yet his eyes were open, thought Galileo, and roamed within the orbits. Did any life revolve with them, did anything move inside? Did sparks of thought still stir?" What do you think?</li>
<li>What is "white matter?" (page 29)</li>
<li>Where is Padua?</li>
<li>Why is weird for Galileo to talk of Italy on page 29?</li>
<li>What is a cortical column?</li>
<li>Could you tell what someone was thinking from monitoring their neurons? How would you do this (see page 28 for line about red and yellow)?</li>
<li>What is the ascending reticular activating system?</li>
<li>Define ontology has used in the quote: "&#x2026; annunciating a principle of causal <i>ontology</i> [italics added]&#x2026;"</li>

<li>Who is Fodor and why are the concepts of modularity and penetrability pertinent to the first few lines of this chapter?</li>
<li>Why is Nicolas Poussin included here do you think?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many of his themes relate to Ovid's Metamorphoses - which is the likely source for the Daphne episode above</li>

<li>Is a cerebellum <a href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/133/3/652">necessary</a> for consciousness? What has more neurons; the cerebrum or the cerebellum? Why might this be a problem for neural theories of consciousness that treat the neuron as the key information processing unit? See also below for neuron numbers.</li>
<li>The Hand Tremor Questions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is this a cerebellar tremor?</li>
<li>Or is it more likely an essential tremor?</li>
<li>Perhaps even Parkinson's?</li>
<li>Why does Tononi put it here?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What point is Frick making on page 39 when he speaks of the "cone's shape stays the same, though when we see it from different angles, the images formed onto our eyes are differently entirely."</li>
<li>Frick uses the word "invariants" on page 40. What does it mean?</li>
<li>Pause a moment to consider the contrast on page 41: "Copernicus was
gone, Poussin was painting." Why is this a puzzle? 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>100 billion cerebellum and 23 billion cerebrum.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why is the jester of the story on page 43 called Modulus?</li>
<li>Comment on the aptness of the two city story as a characterization of cerebellar and cerebral architectures.</li>
<li>What is color constancy? (last paragraph page 39)</li>
<li>What is predictive coding?</li>
<li>There is another element to this story. What is the functional level at which to characterize a complex system? Is there any fundamental change between people in cells doing their jobs and well engineered machines doing the same things? Could we replace a few neurons with machines and leave consciousness unimpaired (<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/511466/microchip-restores-vision/">retinal transplants</a>; cochlear implants). How many replacements would be too many? Why can't we replace them all, at least in theory?</li>
<li>What does this article have to say about a cerebellar origin for Poussin's tremor?</li>
<li>The notions of "local interest" and "rapid adjustment" are characterized as remaining outside consciousness. Compare this to Fodor's notion of cognitive encapsulation.</li>
<li>Could you replace one neuron in the brain with a circuit, two, all?</li>
<li>Could you replace a neuron with a person? Comes from discussion base of page 43.</li>
<li>From base of page 44, what is the Pandemonium model of Selfridge and how does it relate here?</li>
<li>How well does the parable of the two cities actually map onto the differences in communication and connectivity of the cerebellum and cerebrum?</li>

</ol></li>
<li>Who is Father P? Why Do you think so?
Part of the reason for including Pascal here may be his interest in free will and its role in human choice and salvation. This allows us to consider free will, and how it may impact on human choice, and consciousness. It is a trend in contemporary philosophy of mind to deny free will; to argue that it is an illusion.</li>
<li><p>
Are there problems with telling people they don't have free will?
Daniel Dennett thinks so. 
</p>

<p>
Might be worth taking a moment to read and discuss. Note Dennett is not actually talking about whether we have Free Will, but whether we should tell people. But do we have it?

What is the source and full quote from Valentine about her grandfather?
From the Count of Monte Cristo
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is true," said Valentine, as she passed the end of her slender
fingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted
Maximilian to press his lips to them, "and you are a true and
faithful friend; but still you acted from motives of self-interest,
my dear Maximilian, for you well knew that from the moment in which
you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended
between us. You promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of
a brother. For I have no friend but yourself upon earth, who am
neglected and forgotten by my father, harassed and persecuted by my
mother-in-law, and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed
and speechless old man, whose withered hand can no longer press
mine, and who can speak to me with the eye alone, although there
still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor
grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either as a
victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my
only friend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed,
Maximilian, I am very miserable, and if you love me it must be out
of pity.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Looking at the first page of Ch. 20, a voice calls out        from the mist. Who is talking here? This is a question.</li>
<li>Spinoza first makes the statement "this is the source of ignorance absolute; This is were you take your start." What does he mean by this?</li>
<li>What is ignorance as defined in the text?</li>
<li>On pg. 206, What do you think of the "spider-web"/node analogy used in the text? What is it's significance? Did it aid or hinder your understanding of the text? Why?</li>
<li>What do you think of the complex that Galileo and Alturi are climbing? Do you find yourself confused as Galileo was, or seemingly understanding it as Alturi did?</li>
<li>What is "qualia" or "quale?" (go to page 207, particularly the phrase "the scaffold is the space of qualia.") What's the main significance of this statement?</li>
<li>Looking at the second paragraph on pg. 208, what do you think of this representation of knowledge within the text?</li>
<li>All throughout the chapter, Spinoza is represented as cold, distant, and aloof, calling from somewhere far off and "above" this others. Why do you think the author intended to represent Spinoza in this way? What concept, metaphor, or idea could he be trying to allude to here? (see page 208, and NOTES at end of chapter).</li>
<li>What do you think about Alturi's comment in the last sentence of the last paragraph on page 208?: "A complex knows what it can rule out, by virtue of how it's built: it knows its own concepts  which ones are true and which ones are false in it's present state, as specified by the position of the lights  but is uncertain, or should I say it's wholly ignorant, about the rest."</li>
<li>(Mid-page 209): Do you think Spinoza may be speaking about neurons in the brain here? If so, do you think he is being literal here, or more abstract in it's meaning? If not, what else could this be?</li>
<li>At the top of page 211, Spinoza says that he " Perhaps [he has] made them [lenses] all  my life spent as a lens grinder, safe in the obscurity of my art." What do you make of this statement, particularly the last half of the sentence?</li>
<li>In light of what is said on page 211 in the second paragraph (up until the word "carefully") and the pages following, do you suppose that through investigation we will eventually be able to "see the whole picture" here like Spinoza supposes, or do you think we will find ourselves continually climbing upwards and outwards, looking back to continually see the picture unfolding even more?</li>
<li>What does Alturi mean by "interference?"</li>
<li>On page 211, Spinoza tells Galileo to " climb, for only by striving can man be released." What do you think Spinoza meant by this?</li>
<li>(Looking at the bottom of page 212): What is the qualioscope, and it's significance?</li>
<li>(Looking at the last sentences of page 213): " It was not the ropes, not the lenses, not the filaments, not even the individual lights that [Galileo] was meant to see; it was the celestial constellation the diamond of a trillion faces, it was the shape unseen." What could the author mean by the "celestial constellation?" Do you find the imagery here useful or thought provoking? Why/Why not?</li>
<li>What do you think of the seemingly switching of roles between Galileo and Alturi in regards to understanding things on page 214? Does the author have a purpose to this, such as irony, or is this rather an inconsistency in characterization?</li>
<li>On page 215, Galileo makes the comment that He himself is "a shape, a shape extraordinary, the only shape that matters " What do you think about Galileo's statement? Are we truly the "only one that matters"?</li>
<li>What do you think about the author's comments regarding Spinoza and Leibniz within the notes? Is there a subtle or overt bias towards one perspective or another, or anything else we can pick up from the way he writes about the two of them within the notes?</li>

Do you agree with this assessment?

<li>During the chapter, Galileo questions when it is proper to claim someone has a soul. What do you think is an observation of a soul? What do you think Tononi thinks is an appropriate observation?</li>

What do you think about the statement:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"a being’s repertoire of actions may well reveal its repertoire of feelings"
</p>

<li>Is it strange, Tononi is appealing to observable actions when previously it was not required for consciousness to be actionable?</li>

“it will have to do until we come to measure that repertoire inside its brain.”

Galileo claims:

"If forcing him onto the stage of birth is going to cause great pain, to him or those whose consciousness already shines, our innocence would be irresponsibility."

Why/Why not?</li>
<li>On the second page of the chapter (pg 286), the voice heralding from the brass horn states "Acquaintances told me of a painter would could do, with brush and oil, what I set out to do with pen and ink, and stream a swarming torrent of images from a room without a window each time the clock strikes a new minute, I compose a novel sentence." Regarding this quotation:

<li>What do you think the speaker means by "a stream of swarming torrent of images from a room without a window?" Is it purely literal, or is there more to it here?</li>
<li>How may the following picture of the "eye" skylight on page 286 aid or contradict this statement made by the speaker in question?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Why is Sir Ernest Henry so furiously angry with the "darned horn?" What is his primary retort to what was being said?</li>
<li>On page 287, why do you think a picture of a flea has been displayed? Does it have something to do with Ernest and the horn's views of each other?</li>
<li>Why do you believe the horn tries to prevent Ernest from leaving or ending the conversation at many points throughout the chapter?</li>
<li>On page 288, Ernest retorts that "The writer's fate is sealed inside the pages of his book, enchained by the sounds and syllables and sentences; a prisoner of words. But there is more to one experiences than can be said in a million words. Had I to spend an hour, even a single hour, exchanging pleasantries with a bubbly glass at hand a monocle on my eye, I would turn in to a mummy plagued by an unbearable itch. The only gesture left would be to scratch it all away." Regarding this quote:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ernest argues "&#x2026; there is more to one's experiences than can be said in a million words." What do you make of this statement? Do you agree or disagree with this? Using the evidence in the text, how does our understanding of consciousness and "qualia" so to speak support or deny this statement? Looking outside of the book, what evidence can you think of from your own life or other sources that would support/deny this statement?</li>
<li>Ernest also states rather negatively that "The writer's fate is sealed inside the pages of his book &#x2026; a prisoner of words &#x2026; Had I to spend an hour &#x2026; exchanging pleasantries with a bubbly glass at hand a monocle on my eye, I would turn in to a mummy plagued by an unbearable itch." What might this critique of Ernest's actually mean? Is it simply a judgement toward the horn's approach to understanding consciousness, or something more broader and/or deeper about the state of society within the exploration of knowledge?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>On page 289-290, both Galileo and Darwin make statements about the nature of discovery (particularly for consciousness). Within these statements, what similarities are there between the two scholar's conclusions? How may they differ (if they do)? What implications does this have on our current understanding of quale and consciousness, both now and going forward?</li>
<li>On page 291, the horn goes on to say that "&#x2026; exploration can be a sedentary affair. You can discover as much or more sitting at nature's desk, or at the table of the elements &#x2026;  Nature is never more complete than in its smallest parts." Do you agree with this statement? Why/why not? What position would you argue the overall text suggests? Does your own experiences or knowledge support this viewpoint or not?</li>
<li>At the top of page 211, Spinoza says that he " &#x2026; Perhaps [he has] made them [lenses] all my life spent as a lens grinder, safe in the obscurity of my art." What do you make of this statement, particularly the last half of the sentence?</li>
<li>From the bottom of page 291 and into 292, we can see Dr. F being introduced to everyone in the room. From Dr. F's portrayal in the scene:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What does his portrayal say about the author's level of regard and respect toward Dr. F?</li>
<li>What to you think about Dr. F's comments towards Ernest in particular? Are they at all valid or merited, or are they merely speculative and ultimately misleading to what Ernest truly feels?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In a kind of arrogant and cocky manner, Ernest laughs and retorts at the examinations and conclusions Dr. F has drawn, saying on page 293 that he (Ernest) "&#x2026; concurs with (Dr. F): science, too, of course, is a preoccupied with lifting skirts, notably mother nature's. So this fixation of yours, on skirts and what lies under, may be a good thing. But when it comes to such a lofty matter, how sure are you that it is science and not imagination? &#x2026; Is reality overdetermined, or is it over interpreted?" Looking at the following quotation, how much of Ernest's seemingly compliance and acknowledgement of some of Dr. F's thoughts are actually genuine vs sarcastic/passive aggressive? Is Ernest genuine at all here? What else might we take from this statement?Examining the last two pages of the chapter (pages 294 and 295), what significance does the introduction of Emily Dickinson have on our understanding of the chapter? Why might have Tononi have chosen her in particular to finish the chapter?</li>
<li>Using a quotation from Dickinson as a basis for the closing paragraph, what do you think the author means by saying that "Internal differences, where all the meanings are differences internal to each experience, that made it what it was and different from a trillion others the corners of the shape of qualia &#x2026; without a difference that made a difference. Internal difference was internal meaning?"</li>
