* Preface
  - What is meant by the statement that "...Galileo removed the observer from nature..."
  - What is a thought experiment and why is Galileo regarded as a master?
  - What are the goals of the book?
    - Part One: Describe the relations between brain parts and consciousness, and the relation between consciousness and sleep.
    - Part Two: Advance a particular theory of consciousness. We will decide whether we agree and what the alter natives are.
    - Part Three: implications of theories of consciousness.
* 1 Prologue
  - Who was Galileo?
    - Full name.
    - Date of birth and death.
    - Family/relations
    - Principal scientific achievements, and why they are significant.
    - Scientific methodology. Comparison to practice in psychology.
  - What are the core questions and positions being advocated in this chapter?
  - "How could mere matter generate mind?"
  - What philosophical school is being indicated by the statement "What is, is what can be perceived." Alternatively, to be is to be perceived. Who is the philosopher most associated with this position?
  - Are the soul and the person being equated in this prologue? What is the name for the philosophical position that distinguishes between the Res Extenso and Res Cogitans (alternatively between brain and mind)? Who is the philosopher of consciousness most associated with this position?
  - What is the alteration to the /vanitas/ by Pieter Boel?
  - Can you weigh a soul?
  - Can you weigh thought?
  - Why do we believe in other minds?
  - What is a Vanitas? (picture page 8)
  - Are mind and soul the same? How would you know? How could you test?
  - What, in plain language would it mean to have a scientific theory of consciousness? What would you need to explain? What would constitute evidence?
  - Explain quote on page 12 that starts "If ears, tongues, and noses..."
* 2 Introduction
  - What historical figure is "Frick" based on? Why was this person chosen as a guide?
  - What philosophical school would Francis Crick's philosophy of consciousness fall into?
  - What neural structure did Crick think was critical for human consciousness?
  - Describe what theory is being advanced in the italicized paragraph on page 20.
  - How could you produce scores of Galileo as claimed on page 21?
  - What structured is pictured on page 21?
  - Why does the author make a point about Galileo having been right with his telescope?
  - What theory of consciousness is expressed on page 22 where it equates you with your neurons?
  - Does that mean neurons are necessary for consciousness? How would you test?
  - Are their implications for responsibility (see line page 22 about "wanton criminals").
  - Bottom of page 22 where it talks about not being able to be mistaken about consciousness. Describe this position and who it is ascribed to most commonly.
  - What is the name of the problem for consciousness that seeks to account for consciousness emerging from physical elements?
  - What is "dualism?" What are some of the common variants?
  - What is an "explanatory gap?"
  - Read the first few paragraphs of this article and discuss what is meant by the term "psycho-physical" identity.
  - Giordono Bruno is mentioned in the notes as a prominent early believer in heliocentrism. What happened to him? What message does the author expect us to draw from this fact?
* 3 Cerebrum
  - Who was Copernicus?
    Copernicus had a stroke. Apparently awoke from a coma to view the pages of his book and then died peacefully. They identified his skeleton (not found until 2010) by matching DNA to hair from a book in a library in Sweden.
  - There is an important line here: "the universe was an orderly whole, in which displacing any part would disrupt the entire edifice." Why does it mean? Why is it important?
  - What is brain death?
  - Who was Wilder Penfield?
  - Why is he included here?
  - What was Penfield's theory of the brain and consciousness?
  - What is the cerebrum?
  - What are the black spaces in the MRI scan on page 27?
  - What is the Greek origin of the term Thalamus?
    bedroom
  - What does "Functional Specialization" mean?
  - Where is the region of the brain specialized for detecting motion?
  - What is described by "Gallileo thought of the translucent mass, gutlike in its folds..."
  - Key discussion question: is there a region of the brain for consciousness. Discuss Frick's condition. Evidence pro and con.
  - What is the term for the condition where people cannot recognize faces? 
    Prosopagnosia.
  - "And yet his eyes were open, thought Galileo, and roamed within the orbits. Did any life revolve with them, did anything move inside? Did sparks of thought still stir?" What do you think?
  - What is "white matter?" (page 29)
  - Where is Padua?
  - Why is weird for Galileo to talk of Italy on page 29?
  - What is a cortical column?
  - Could you tell what someone was thinking from monitoring their neurons? How would you do this (see page 28 for line about red and yellow)?
  - What is the ascending reticular activating system?
  - Define ontology has used in the quote: "... annunciating a principle of causal /ontology/ [italics added]..."
  - Why is the Cartesian Theatre a problem (or why is the homonculus)? Page 30
* 4 Cerebellum
  - Who is Fodor and why are the concepts of modularity and penetrability pertinent to the first few lines of this chapter?
  - Why is Nicolas Poussin included here do you think?
    + Many of his themes relate to Ovid's Metamorphoses - which is the likely source for the Daphne episode above
  - Who were the [[http://books.google.ca/books?id=QGMRBwz7oWsC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=pope+protomedicus&source=bl&ots=3rNQ7FjZrB&sig=jnFdJcz1BsBpjnqpp_X5SY6ufxo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VyBzVJj9DZKMyASP0IKwCA&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=pope%20protomedicus&f=false][Protomedicus]]?
  - What are [[https://www.google.ca/search?q=putti&num=20&sa=X&hl=en&biw=1434&bih=759&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&ei=jyBzVLaBJ4WgyAS97IBw&ved=0CDcQsAQ][Putti]]?
  - Is a cerebellum [[http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/133/3/652][necessary]] for consciousness? What has more neurons; the cerebrum or the cerebellum? Why might this be a problem for neural theories of consciousness that treat the neuron as the key information processing unit? See also below for neuron numbers.
  - The Hand Tremor Questions
    - Is this a cerebellar tremor?
    - Or is it more likely an essential tremor?
    - Perhaps even Parkinson's?
    - Why does Tononi put it here?
  - What point is Frick making on page 39 when he speaks of the "cone's shape stays the same, though when we see it from different angles, the images formed onto our eyes are differently entirely."
  - Frick uses the word "invariants" on page 40. What does it mean?
  - Pause a moment to consider the contrast on page 41: "Copernicus was
   gone, Poussin was painting." Why is this a puzzle? 
    - 100 billion cerebellum and 23 billion cerebrum.
  - Why is the jester of the story on page 43 called Modulus?
  - Comment on the aptness of the two city story as a characterization of cerebellar and cerebral architectures.
  - What is color constancy? (last paragraph page 39)
  - What is predictive coding?
  - There is another element to this story. What is the functional level at which to characterize a complex system? Is there any fundamental change between people in cells doing their jobs and well engineered machines doing the same things? Could we replace a few neurons with machines and leave consciousness unimpaired ([[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/511466/microchip-restores-vision/][retinal transplants]]; cochlear implants). How many replacements would be too many? Why can't we replace them all, at least in theory?
  - What does this article have to say about a cerebellar origin for Poussin's tremor?
  - The notions of "local interest" and "rapid adjustment" are characterized as remaining outside consciousness. Compare this to Fodor's notion of cognitive encapsulation.
  - Could you replace one neuron in the brain with a circuit, two, all?
  - Could you replace a neuron with a person? Comes from discussion base of page 43.
  - From base of page 44, what is the Pandemonium model of Selfridge and how does it relate here?
  - How well does the parable of the two cities actually map onto the differences in communication and connectivity of the cerebellum and cerebrum?
* 5 Two Blind Patients
  - Why does Galileo use the term /circle/ of sick painters? Making reference with Dante's journey.
  - Analyze the phrase of page 48: "Vision is in the mind, not in the eye."
  - What is the origin of the idea of vision as unconscious inference?
    - Discussion in [[http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/352/1358/1121.full-text.pdf][Gregory]].
    - Source [[https://archive.org/stream/lecturesonscient00helmiala#page/262/mode/2up][Helmholtz?]]/Theory of Empirical Vision (why "empirical"?)
  - Who was Johannes Kepler
  - Why the puzzle about the inverted image? Who first proved that the image on the retina is inverted and how?
  - What are microsaccades?
  - What is methanol, and what are the effects of methanol poisoning?
  - What is the relation between visual imagery and sight?
  - Is it possible that one could be blind and not know it? What are the implications of this for subjective theories of consciousness?
  - Define confabulaton.
  - Define anosoganosia.
* 6 Locked In
  - What are the Seven Deadly Sins?
    1. luxuria (lechery/lust)
    2. gula (gluttony)
    3. avaritia (avarice/greed)
    4. acedia (sloth/discouragement)
    5. ira (wrath)
    6. invidia (envy)
    7. superbia (pride)
  - Who is Father P? Why Do you think so?
    Part of the reason for including Pascal here may be his interest in free will and its role in human choice and salvation. This allows us to consider free will, and how it may impact on human choice, and consciousness. It is a trend in contemporary philosophy of mind to deny free will; to argue that it is an illusion.
  - Are there problems with telling people they don't have free will?
    Daniel Dennett thinks so. 
   
    Might be worth taking a moment to read and discuss. Note Dennett is not actually talking about whether we have Free Will, but whether we should tell people. But do we have it? What are the neuroscientists [[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-neuro-060909-153151][saying]]?
  - Who invented the calculating machine? Who invented programming?
    1. [[http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/][Babbage]]
    2. [[http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/adalovelace/][Ada Lovelace]]
    3. [[http://www.computerculture.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/jacquard2.jpeg]] and another [[http://www.computersciencelab.com/ComputerHistory/HtmlHelp/Images2/JacquardLoom.jpg]].

  - What is the source and full quote from Valentine about her grandfather?
    From the Count of Monte Cristo

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    It is true," said Valentine, as she passed the end of her slender
    fingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted
    Maximilian to press his lips to them, "and you are a true and
    faithful friend; but still you acted from motives of self-interest,
    my dear Maximilian, for you well knew that from the moment in which
    you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended
    between us. You promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of
    a brother. For I have no friend but yourself upon earth, who am
    neglected and forgotten by my father, harassed and persecuted by my
    mother-in-law, and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed
    and speechless old man, whose withered hand can no longer press
    mine, and who can speak to me with the eye alone, although there
    still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor
    grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either as a
    victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my
    only friend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed,
    Maximilian, I am very miserable, and if you love me it must be out
    of pity.

* 20 Palace of Light
  - Looking at the first page of Ch. 20, a voice calls out        from the mist. Who is talking here? This is a question.
  - Spinoza first makes the statement "this is the source of ignorance absolute; This is were you take your start." What does he mean by this?  
  - What is ignorance as defined in the text? 
  - On pg. 206, What do you think of the "spider-web"/node analogy used in the text? What is it's significance? Did it aid or hinder your understanding of the text? Why? 
  - What do you think of the complex that Galileo and Alturi are climbing? Do you find yourself confused as Galileo was, or seemingly understanding it as Alturi did? 
  - What is "qualia" or "quale?" (go to page 207, particularly the phrase "the scaffold is the space of qualia.") What's the main significance of this statement? 
  - Looking at the second paragraph on pg. 208, what do you think of this representation of knowledge within the text? 
  - All throughout the chapter, Spinoza is represented as cold, distant, and aloof, calling from somewhere far off and "above" this others. Why do you think the author intended to represent Spinoza in this way? What concept, metaphor, or idea could he be trying to allude to here? (see page 208, and NOTES at end of chapter). 
  - What do you think about Alturi's comment in the last sentence of the last paragraph on page 208?: "A complex knows what it can rule out, by virtue of how it's built: it knows its own concepts  which ones are true and which ones are false in it's present state, as specified by the position of the lights  but is uncertain, or should I say it's wholly ignorant, about the rest." 
  - (Mid-page 209): Do you think Spinoza may be speaking about neurons in the brain here? If so, do you think he is being literal here, or more abstract in it's meaning? If not, what else could this be?  
  - At the top of page 211, Spinoza says that he " Perhaps [he has] made them [lenses] all  my life spent as a lens grinder, safe in the obscurity of my art." What do you make of this statement, particularly the last half of the sentence? 
  - In light of what is said on page 211 in the second paragraph (up until the word "carefully") and the pages following, do you suppose that through investigation we will eventually be able to "see the whole picture" here like Spinoza supposes, or do you think we will find ourselves continually climbing upwards and outwards, looking back to continually see the picture unfolding even more? 
  - What does Alturi mean by "interference?" 
  - On page 211, Spinoza tells Galileo to " climb, for only by striving can man be released." What do you think Spinoza meant by this? 
  - (Looking at the bottom of page 212): What is the qualioscope, and it's significance? 
  - (Looking at the last sentences of page 213): " It was not the ropes, not the lenses, not the filaments, not even the individual lights that [Galileo] was meant to see; it was the celestial constellation the diamond of a trillion faces, it was the shape unseen." What could the author mean by the "celestial constellation?" Do you find the imagery here useful or thought provoking? Why/Why not? 
  - What do you think of the seemingly switching of roles between Galileo and Alturi in regards to understanding things on page 214? Does the author have a purpose to this, such as irony, or is this rather an inconsistency in characterization? 
  - On page 215, Galileo makes the comment that He himself is "a shape, a shape extraordinary, the only shape that matters " What do you think about Galileo's statement? Are we truly the "only one that matters"?

  - Why are the chapters collectively called "Nightfall"? What is the guiding thread through these chapters?
  - Damasio says that sensation is irreplaceably tied to the body. Do you think it's possible for a consciousness to experience sensation without a bodily reference? (i.e  could we make an A.I. that was in constant pain?)
  - Tononi asks the question: "Does a sensation exist if we have no memory of it?" Why do you think this question is important?
  - In the last point in the notes Tononi suggests that that the ability to alter the "fabric" of neurons would result in horrific new sensations. Why do you think these new sensations are horrific?

  - Galileo claims:
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    "If forcing him onto the stage of birth is going to cause great pain, to him or those whose consciousness already shines, our innocence would be irresponsibility."
